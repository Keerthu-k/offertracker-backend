# OfferTracker

A career intelligence API for professionals who want genuine clarity in their job search — not another chore.

---

## 1. What is OfferTracker?

OfferTracker is a **FastAPI-powered backend** built around one core idea: the job search deserves more than a Kanban board.

Most trackers record what happened. OfferTracker is built to help you understand *why* — why certain interview rounds go well, why certain resume versions perform better, what skill gaps keep surfacing, and how consistent your effort actually is.

At its core it is a **personal job search database**: every application, every interview stage, every offer and rejection, every reflection written after the fact. The entry form is intentionally flat — just `company_name` and `role_title` are required. Everything else is optional. Adding an application should take five seconds, not five minutes.

Beyond the personal tracker, OfferTracker has a lightweight **social layer** — follow friends, join circles, share updates and tips. Not a social media platform, not a competition. Just a small space where people navigating the same experience can see how each other is doing.

Progress is surfaced through **milestones**: quiet, automatic markers reached by actually using the product. No points, no leaderboard.

---

## 2. Why This Exists

| Problem | What OfferTracker does about it |
|---|---|
| Forgetting what happened in each interview round | Structured **Stages** with per-round notes, prep notes, and questions asked |
| Not knowing which resume version performs best | **Resume Versions** — label, store, and link each version to every application |
| No idea why rejections keep happening | **Outcomes** with compensation details, **Reflections** with structured post-mortems |
| Skill gaps identified in interviews slip through the cracks | `skill_gaps` JSON field in Reflections + a dedicated improvement plan |
| Job search feels like searching alone | **Follows**, **Groups**, and a shared **Post** feed |
| No sense of consistent effort | **Streak tracking** and natural **Milestones** reached through real activity |
| Interesting jobs forgotten before applying | **Saved Jobs** — bookmark postings and convert them to applications when ready |
| No visibility into search performance | **Analytics dashboard** — pipeline funnel, response rates, source effectiveness, salary insights |

## 3. Data Model

### Application Lifecycle

```
Saved → Applied → Interviewing → Offer → Accepted
                              ↘ Rejected  (at any point)
                              ↘ Withdrawn (at any point)
```

Auto-transitions happen silently:
- Creating an application with `status: Applied` auto-sets `applied_date` to today.
- Adding a Stage to an `Applied` application auto-moves it to `Interviewing`.
- Posting an Outcome auto-moves the application to `Offer`.

### Core Application Structure

```
Application (company, role, status, salary range, source, priority, ...)
    │
    ├── Stages[]        (Recruiter Call, Technical, Onsite, ...)
    ├── Outcome         (offer details, compensation, deadline)
    ├── Reflection      (what_worked, what_failed, skill_gaps, improvement_plan)
    ├── Contacts[]      (recruiters, hiring managers, referrals)
    ├── Documents[]     (cover letters, portfolios, references)
    └── Reminders[]     (follow-up dates, deadlines, interview prep)
```

### Social & Progress Layer

```
User ──► Follows        (stay connected with people on the same journey)
     ──► Groups         (circles — public or private)
     ──► Posts          (updates, tips, milestones, questions, resources, celebrations)
     ──► Milestones     (12 progress markers, reached automatically)
     ──► Saved Jobs     (bookmarked postings, convertible to full applications)
     ──► Activity Log   (automatic timeline of every action taken)
```

## 4. Authentication

Authentication is handled entirely by **Supabase Auth**:

1. **Register** (`POST /api/v1/auth/register`) — signs up via Supabase Auth, creates a profile row in `public.users`, and awards the *Getting Started* milestone. Returns a session JWT.
2. **Login** (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`) — authenticates via Supabase Auth, returns the session JWT.
3. **All other endpoints** require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, verified by the `get_current_user` FastAPI dependency against the `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`.

Every resource is scoped strictly to the authenticated user. Users can only read or modify their own data. Public profiles are opt-in via `profile_visibility`.

## 6. Milestones

No points, no leaderboard. Just 12 quiet markers that acknowledge real effort.

| Milestone | Triggered by |
|-----------|--------------|
| Getting Started | Creating an account |
| First Application | Creating the first application |
| Building Momentum | 10 applications created |
| In the Zone | 25 applications created |
| Self-Reflective | Writing the first reflection |
| Growth Mindset | Writing 10 reflections |
| One Week Strong | 7 consecutive days of activity |
| Thirty Day Streak | 30 consecutive days of activity |
| Connected | Following 5 users |
| Part of a Circle | Joining a group |
| Sharing Insights | Creating a post |
| Offer Received | Recording a job offer |

The only metric surfaced on an ongoing basis is **streak days** — how many consecutive days you have been active. A gentle, honest signal.

### Design Principles

- **Flat over nested.** The application form is two required fields. Everything else is optional.
- **User-scoped by default.** Every resource is private unless explicitly made public.
- **Auto-transitions are silent.** Status changes triggered by user actions (adding a stage, logging an offer) happen automatically, so the UI stays consistent without extra API calls.
- **Progress, not performance.** Milestones and streaks reward consistency, not volume.
- **Social without the noise.** Posts and follows are lightweight — a place to share the journey, not perform it.

## 9. Setup & Running

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or later
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keerthu-k/offertracker-backend.git
cd offertracker-backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/).
2. Open the **SQL Editor** in the Supabase dashboard and run the entire contents of [supabase_schema_final.sql](supabase_schema_final.sql).
3. Go to **Storage → New Bucket** and create a bucket named `resumes`. Set it to public.
4. In **Settings → API**, copy your Project URL, `anon` key, `service_role` key, and JWT secret.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### Running the Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

| URL | What you get |
|-----|-------------|
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | API root |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` | Swagger UI — interactive, authenticated |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` | ReDoc — clean reference view |

### Running Tests

The test suite uses a fully mocked Supabase client — no live database is needed:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## 10. Future Direction

- **Richer Analytics** — stage-level conversion funnels, time-to-offer tracking, resume version performance comparison.
- **AI Integrations** — reflection summarisation, auto-tagged skill gaps, job description keyword analysis.
- **Notifications** — configurable nudges for streak breaks, reminder deadlines, and milestone triggers.
- **Granular Privacy** — move beyond the current public/private binary to per-resource visibility controls.
- **Frontend** — a minimal, focused dashboard. The API schema is fully documented in [api_schema_for_frontend.md](api_schema_for_frontend.md) and ready for handoff.
